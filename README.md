## What! Why?

This is **by no means** a(n attempt at a) replacement tool for things like [Robo](https://github.com/consolidation/Robo).
I just thought it would be fun to create a **bash script** generator and executor
for PHP and it was a nice excuse to create an OO targeted PHP library again...

## Install using composer

Open a shell, `cd` to your poject and type:

```sh
composer require malc0mn/php-basher
```

or edit composer.json and add:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "malc0mn/php-basher": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

## Usage

TODO: complete this readme :/
